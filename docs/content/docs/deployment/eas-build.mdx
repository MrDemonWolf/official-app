description: Building the app with EAS Build for iOS and Android.

# EAS Build

The app is built using [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) from Expo.

## Build Profiles

| Profile | Distribution | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `development` | Internal | Dev client for local testing |
| `production` | Store | App Store / Play Store release |

Both profiles use `appVersionSource: "remote"` with auto-increment, so version numbers are managed by EAS.

## Running Builds

EAS CLI must be available in your PATH. If using zsh, run via `zsh -l` to ensure PATH is set:

```bash
# iOS build
eas build --platform ios

# Android build
eas build --platform android

# Both platforms
eas build --platform all
```

### Development Build

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile development
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

Development builds include the Expo dev client for hot reloading and debugging.

### Production Build

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

Production builds are optimized and signed for store distribution.

## Credentials

### iOS

- Distribution certificate and provisioning profile managed by EAS
- Run `eas credentials` to view or update

### Android

- JKS keystore for signing
- Google Service Account JSON for Play Store uploads
- Run `eas credentials` to manage

## Configuration

Build configuration lives in `eas.json` at the project root. Key settings:
