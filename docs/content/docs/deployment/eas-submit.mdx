# EAS Submit

[EAS Submit](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/introduction/) handles uploading builds to the App Store and Google Play Store.

## App Store (iOS)

```bash
eas submit --platform ios
```

This uploads the latest iOS build to App Store Connect. You'll need:

- An Apple Developer account
- App Store Connect API key (or Apple ID credentials)
- The app must be created in App Store Connect first

## Play Store (Android)

```bash
eas submit --platform android
```

This uploads the latest Android build to the Google Play Console. You'll need:

- A Google Play Developer account
- Google Service Account JSON key with appropriate permissions
- The app must be created in the Play Console first

## Automated Submission

You can chain build and submit:

```bash
eas build --platform ios --auto-submit
eas build --platform android --auto-submit
```

This automatically submits the build after it completes.

## Credentials Management

```bash
# View and manage all credentials
eas credentials

# Platform-specific
eas credentials --platform ios
eas credentials --platform android
```
