# PackRelay

[PackRelay](https://github.com/MrDemonWolf/packrelay) is a WordPress plugin that bridges mobile app contact forms to WPForms. It accepts form submissions via REST API and validates them with Firebase App Check tokens.

## How It Works

1. The app collects form data and a Firebase App Check token
2. Data is sent to the PackRelay REST endpoint
3. PackRelay validates the App Check token with Firebase
4. If valid, PackRelay submits the data to WPForms
5. WPForms processes the submission (sends email, stores entry)

## API Endpoint

```
POST {PACKRELAY_API_URL}/submit/{FORM_ID}
```

### Request

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "1": "First Name",
    "2": "Last Name",
    "3": "email@example.com",
    "4": "555-0123",
    "5": "Message body"
  },
  "app_check_token": "eyJhbGciOi..."
}
```

The `fields` object maps WPForms field IDs to values. Field IDs are configured in the WPForms form builder.

### Response

**Success**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Form submitted successfully"
}
```

**Error**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed: invalid App Check token"
}
```
