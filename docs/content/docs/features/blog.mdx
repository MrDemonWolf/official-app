# Blog

The blog feature displays WordPress posts with infinite scroll, search, and category filtering.

- Posts fetched 10 at a time via `getPosts(page, perPage)`
- Each post rendered as a `BlogPostCard` with featured image, title, excerpt, date, and category
- Pull-to-refresh support
- Cache pre-population: individual post data is written to the query cache when the list loads, so detail screens render instantly

## Search

**Hook**: `useSearchPosts(query)`

- Debounced search input
- Infinite scroll through search results
- Uses WordPress `?search=` parameter
