# Bookmarks

Users can bookmark blog posts for later reading. Bookmarks are stored locally using SQLite via `expo-sqlite`.

## Storage

Bookmarks are persisted in a local SQLite database on the device. This means:

- Bookmarks are available offline
- No server-side storage needed
- Data stays on the device

## Hooks

### `useBookmarks()`

Returns the list of all bookmarked posts.

### `useIsBookmarked(postId)`

Returns whether a specific post is bookmarked.

### `useToggleBookmark()`

Returns a mutation function to toggle a post's bookmark status.

### `useClearBookmarks()`

Returns a mutation function to clear all bookmarks.

## Components

### Bookmark Button

**Component**: `BookmarkButton` (`src/components/bookmark-button.tsx`)

A toggle button that appears on blog post cards and detail screens. Shows filled/outline state based on bookmark status.

### Bookmarks Screen

**Route**: `(tabs)/(blog)/bookmarks.tsx`

Lists all bookmarked posts with the same card layout as the main blog list. Accessible from the Blog tab.

## Service Layer

`src/services/bookmarks.ts` provides the SQLite operations:

- `getBookmarks()` — Fetch all bookmarked post IDs
- `addBookmark(postId)` — Save a post ID
- `removeBookmark(postId)` — Remove a post ID
- `isBookmarked(postId)` — Check if a post is bookmarked
- `clearBookmarks()` — Remove all bookmarks
