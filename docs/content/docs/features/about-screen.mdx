# About Screen

The About screen displays the app owner's profile, pulling data from the WordPress REST API user endpoint.

## Data Source

User data is fetched via `useAbout()` which calls `getUser()` from the WordPress service:

```
GET /wp-json/wp/v2/users/{WORDPRESS_USER_ID}
```

The user ID is configured via the `EXPO_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_USER_ID` environment variable (defaults to `1`).

## Profile Elements

| Element | Source | Fallback |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Name | `user.name` | "MrDemonWolf" |
| Role title | `user.acf.role_title` | Not shown |
| Avatar | `user.avatar_urls` (highest resolution) | Gravatar default |
| Banner | Blurred avatar at 800px | — |
| Bio | `user.description` | Hardcoded fallback paragraphs |
| Social links | `user.acf.social_links` (ACF repeater) | Not shown |

## Parallax Banner (iOS)

On iOS, the About screen features a parallax banner effect using `react-native-reanimated`:

- Banner image scales up on overscroll (pull down)
- Parallax translation on normal scroll
- Dark gradient overlay for readability
- Avatar overlaps the bottom of the banner

The Android version uses a simplified layout without parallax animation.

## Social Links

Social links come from an ACF repeater field (`social_links`) on the WordPress user. Each link has:

- `platform` — Platform identifier (e.g. `github`, `twitter`, `discord`)
- `url` — The profile URL
- `label` — Display label
- `icon_url` — Optional custom icon URL

The app bundles 14 brand SVG icons that are tinted at runtime:

github, discord, x, twitch, youtube, facebook, instagram, bluesky, linkedin, mastodon, threads, tiktok, reddit, steam

For the special `website` platform, a globe icon is shown. If a platform has no bundled icon, it falls back to `icon_url` from the ACF field, then to the globe icon.

## ACF Fields Required

See [ACF Fields](/docs/wordpress/acf-fields) for WordPress setup instructions.
