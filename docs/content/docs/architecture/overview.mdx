# Architecture Overview

The app is built on **Expo SDK 55** with **React Native 0.83** and the **New Architecture** enabled. It uses Expo Router for file-based routing, React Query for server state management, and NativeWind/Tailwind for styling.

## Project Structure

Source code lives under `src/` to keep the root clean. Expo Router auto-detects `src/app/`.

```
src/
├── app/                    # Expo Router file-based routing
├── assets/images/          # App icons, splash, favicons, social SVGs
├── components/             # Reusable React components
├── contexts/               # React Context providers (settings)
├── hooks/                  # Custom React hooks (queries, haptics, form state)
├── lib/                    # Utilities (HTML parsing, font scale, WP helpers)
├── services/               # API layers (WordPress, PackRelay, Firebase, notifications, bookmarks)
├── types/                  # TypeScript type definitions
└── global.css              # Tailwind/NativeWind imports

plugins/                    # Custom Expo config plugins
```

## Key Technologies

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Expo SDK | 55 | App framework and build tooling |
| React Native | 0.83 | Native UI rendering (New Architecture) |
| Expo Router | 55 | File-based navigation |
| React Query | v5 | Server state management and caching |
| NativeWind | v5 | Tailwind CSS for React Native |
| Tailwind CSS | v4 | Utility-first styling |
| SQLite | via expo-sqlite | Local bookmark storage |
| AsyncStorage | via settings context | User preferences persistence |
| Firebase App Check | v23 | Device attestation for API security |

## Path Aliases

TypeScript path alias `@/*` maps to `src/` (configured in `tsconfig.json`):

```ts
import { useAbout } from '@/hooks/use-about';
import { getUser } from '@/services/wordpress';
```

## Experimental Features

- **Typed routes** — `experiments.typedRoutes` enabled for compile-time route safety
- **React Compiler** — `experiments.reactCompiler` enabled for automatic memoization
